### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of IT Convergence Engineering in Gachon University, Korea, and working as a researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Ju Jung](https://sites.google.com/site/coolyjjung/), Gachon University. I have completed my master's from the same department (2019-2021). My master's thesis was on free-form image inpainting using global and local attention mechanisms.
<br><br>
My undergrad was from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh](https://ulab.edu.bd/) (2013-2018). My undergrad supervisor was [S. M. Mahbubur Rahman, Ph.D.](https://mahbubur.buet.ac.bd/) and my undergrad thesis was on video summarization using CNN with multimodal data.
<br><br>
My current research interests include camera sensors, 2D & 3D image processing, and deep generative models. 
<br><br>
Here are some queries about me....
<br>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on image inpainting and event cameras.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about camera sensors and cuda programming.
- ðŸ’¬ I usually work with PyTorch. I have experiences with TensorFlow (1.x), Keras and MATLAB. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: smnadimuddin at gmail dot com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have recently stopped smoking.
