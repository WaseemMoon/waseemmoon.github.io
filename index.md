### Muhammad Waseem Hafiz

*Hi there ðŸ‘‹*

I am a computer vision researcher with 3+ years of experience in image synthesis, stereo vision, bio-inspired sensors, and generative models. I am currently working as a researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University. My current research interests lie in modeling visual perception systems, camera sensors, 2D/3D image processing, and deep generative models.

I have completed my master's from the Department of Software (2019-2021) from Gachon University, under the supervision of  [Prof. Yong Ju Jung](https://sites.google.com/site/coolyjjung/). I have completed my undergraduate studies from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)](https://ulab.edu.bd/) (2013-2017), under the supervision of [Dr. S. M. Mahbubur Rahman](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/faculty/details/dr-s-m-mahbubur-rahman).
